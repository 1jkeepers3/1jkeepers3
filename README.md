- I love learning new things and stimulating my brain. I like solving problems and making things easier for people with technology. I love that new technology can change the world. I think if I were born 2 million years ago, I would have hunted and gathered, and if I were born 10,000 years ago, I would have farmed. I live in the age of the internet and AI, so I code! **.**
