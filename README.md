<h3 align="center">Master of Science in Computer Science Graduate from Stevens Institute of Technology (recent)</h3>

- I’m a recent graduate of Stevens Institute of Technology, where I earned a Master of Science in Computer Science with a focus on Machine Learning and AI, and I’m currently seeking full-time opportunities in the NYC metro area. Through my academic work, I’ve developed a strong interest in applied AI, machine learning, and building systems that translate technical capabilities into real user impact, with a particular appreciation for working at the intersection of engineering and product through iterative development and testing. I’m excited about opportunities where I can contribute technically, learn quickly, and collaborate with teams building meaningful, AI-driven products in fast-paced environments.  **.**
