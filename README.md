<h3 align="center">Master of Science in Computer Science Graduate from Stevens Institute of Technology (recent)</h3>

- I’m a recent graduate of Stevens Institute of Technology, where I earned a Master of Science in Computer Science with a focus on Machine Learning and AI, and I’m currently seeking full-time opportunities in the NYC metro area. Through my academic work, I’ve developed a strong interest in back-end development, machine learning, and building systems that can translate technical capabilities into real user impact. Through my academic projects and my Software Engineering Internship at Hamilton Square, I’ve gained experience collaborating on teams, developing scalable applications, and applying AI-driven solutions. Please take a look at my projects and feel free to reach out to connect—I’d love to discuss how I can contribute to your team.  **.**
